<h2>Super McDonalds Smash</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This game takes 'Food Fight' to a whole nother' level! 

It's a fighting game where the characters are food!
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I was able to incorporate health bar and hit boxes for the characters to interact. 
I also added a feature where if a player holds down a keyboard longer, their character moves faster in the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned that game designing is hard!

Personally the hardest part of making it was going through documentations and example to learn about what things do what
and how they interact with things. The easiest thing for me was seeing my code come to life, which helped me a lot with
making changes along the way.

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I wanted to make my game into a fighting game. My game started out using the Phaser Example called "firstgame".

This helped me with getting my characters walking on a platform, and with collisions. I wasn't able to find any examples that used my template with no class
and has a fighting style to i tried to stitch a bunch of resources I found from the documentation and general questions I had.  

These two website helped me understand collision and how health works in phaser. 
The two websites: https://docs.idew.org/video-game/project-references/phaser-coding/physics-and-collisions & https://docs.idew.org/video-game/project-references/phaser-coding/sprites-animations-and-health. 

I also used the documentation for tweens, keyboard input, and audio.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A fighting game where you choose either a nugget or french fry to stomp and kill your opponent.

</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I picked the challenge of "must be played with someone else".
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<ul>
Input: keyboard
Randomness: deterministic
Play Style: Competitor
Genre: fighting
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic that this prototype is evaluating is sprite collision, to use as attacking, and how that
sprite collision reacts with its health bar. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want my players to experience trial and error and have them strategize what approach is best to take down the opponent. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
In this prototype the player picks either the nugget or the french fry to fight. Since it's a co-op game the other player will choose
the other character. Ideally I would have wanted a single player option where the other character is an AI. The instructions display on the screen for a short while. The nugget moves left, right, and up 
with the arrow keys respectively. While the french fry moves left, right, and up with the a, d, and w keys on the keyboard. If the characters hold on their left and right for a longer time they are able to move faster. Since the platform is slippery the momentum is conserved. Each player attemtps
 to jump and move around on the other's head to deal damage, but the played being jumped on can move around and jump to deal damage back. Each time a player deals damage their respective health bars will display the damage being done in real-time. Once a player deals enough damage the health bar of the opponent will be red and the 
 winning screen will display the winner and all keyboard inputs are disabled, where ideally a restart button would appear and restart the game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Some player strategies that I expect is whether playing defensive is better than offensive, faster better than slower, or if counter-attacking by letting the opponent stomp on you is more beneficial. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting is a McDonalds. 
The nugget and french fry were minding their own business when they overheard some customers arguing which is better, the nugget or the french fry. 
The nugget and french fry turned to each other and started to argue about which one of them was better. They decided that a brawl was the only way to settle it! 
Pick your side and fight for it!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience are people that like fighting games and/or people that are passionate about McDonalds fast food. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
My game takes rougly about 2-5 minutes.
</li>
