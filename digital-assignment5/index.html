      <h2>Spline Cleanup</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Originality:</strong>
          The Originality of my game is that the map is something I made for
          this game and the character was also made by me. The game has also
          elements of skill and randomness which makes for a great combo! I have
          also made all the scenes for each part of the game as well as designed
          their outlays.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
          I created a tilemap that has collisions, as well as creating enemies
          that also collide with the landscape. Since the enemies bounce
          irregularly no single game will be the same. The player also has
          movement with the cursour keys and when they collide with the splimes
          it elimants them.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
          In this prototype I learned how to work with tile maps, I learned how
          to create scenes and transtition data between them. The hardest part
          was dealing with camera zoom, and how EVERYTHING is affected by it.
          The easiest thing was transtition scenses.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
          I borrowed a couple assets but made the rest by scratch
          <ul>
            <li>
              Splime:
              <a
                href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonquest/images/6/60/Slime_Artwork.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/700?cb=20201021141416"
                >Slime Picture</a
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              Tile Pieces:
              <a href="https://www.kenney.nl/assets/roguelike-rpg-pack"
                >Tiles used for the map</a
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
          No code was borrowed from a Phaser Example.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>High Concept:</strong>
          You play as a camp ranger for Camp Latiki and your job to race against
          the clock to clean up all the splimes that have made their way into
          the camp! A one-sentence summary of your game.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Theme:</strong>
          The these i decided to use was: cleaning!
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
          Input: Direct Randomness: a lot of randomness Genre: side-scroller,
          role-playing game, adventure Play Style: Collector, Explorer, Achiever
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
          The game mechanic that the prototype is evaluating is player movement
          as well as enemy and enviornment collision.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
          I want players to experince that feeling where they are so close to
          winning but have a couple slimes out in random locations so that they
          waste time looking all over the place.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Gameplay:</strong>
          Using the cursour arrows, a play can move around the landscape and
          interact with the environment and the splimes. To eliminate a splime
          just most close enough in the range and the magical rake will vanish
          them out of existance. During the players play time A UI will show the
          current amound of splimes as well as the current time left. Ideally I
          would have wanted an action to be made to eliminate the splimes as
          well as the play to take damage from the splimes.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Strategies:</strong>
          Some strategies that I expect are that some players will just scatter
          and run through, while others might check ever nook and cranny to make
          sure they got everything before moving on.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
          Its around mid day, and you last rememeber doing some maintenence at
          the nearby cementery...but what do u see in the distance?...
          SPLIMES?!?! They are destroying the lawn and scaring everyone away.
          You must get rid of them, and if you don't get rid of them in time
          then they will take over Camp Latiki! So you wield your magical rake
          and get running to the splimes. Camp Latiki was where you were brought
          up and molded in the the ultimate human, are you really going to let
          it become overrun by splimes! smh DO THIS FOR CAMP LATIKI!!
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Target Audience:</strong>
          The demographic i'm trying to reach is anyone who likes games that
          keep them on their toes.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Play Time:</strong>
          This game takes at max 100 seconds, but can be completed faster.
