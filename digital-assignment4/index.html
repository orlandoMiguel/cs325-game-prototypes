<h2>A Pirate's Life For Me!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The originality of my game is that it is only 20 seconds long, also that randomness of my game is addictive.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The intresting part of my game is the randomness of the wires, combined with the timer keeps you on ur toes. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned that you kinda have to pace yourself and think about what you are going to do and wonder if this is possible in phaser. 
The hardest part of this prototype was trying to create random wires. 
The easiest part of this prototype was adding the text and images hehe. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bomb: <a href="https://line.17qq.com/articles/uuthqqarx.html">Bomb</a></li>
<li>Power Switch: <a href="https://www.pikpng.com/pngvi/mmxJoh_this-free-icons-png-design-of-knife-switch-off-electricity-power-switch/">Power Switch</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I did borrow code from phaser but this game doesnt closely resemble anything I saw on phaser.
The phaser examples that I borrowed code from were: https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/game-objects/lights/change-scene , https://phasergames.com/phaser-3-basics-images-text-and-click/ , https://phaser.io/examples/v2/time/custom-timer , https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/paths/complex-path-bounds , 
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You are in a room with one chance to defuse the bomb, if you click the wrong wire number the bomb explodes!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The challenge I used was: 'Your Game takes exactly 20 seconds to play'!
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Mouse 
Randomness: a lot of randomness
Genre: Puzzle
Play Style: Performer & Achiever
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic in this prototype was randomness and I wanted to see how that plays a part in games. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to feel like they are on their toes every game, especially since they are just thrown into the madness. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The game opens up with 9 wires jumbled up and connected from a power switch to a bomb. The players have to decide which wire is the wire connected to the clock. They have to use their mouse and click on the wire that they think is attached to the clock. If the player chooses the wrong wire number they lose and a game over scene appears. If the player chooses the right wire they win and a game win scene appears. It's fairly basic but has a lot of moving parts, I also had to get rid of some features for time sake. I want the players to be able to pick the wires themselves, i even turned the cursour in a scissor. I also would have wanted to a menu where the player could choose the difficuly. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Some strategies that I thought about is which side the player would chose to check if its the right wire. Also if they want to speed up their time would it be better to guess or take their time. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
"Hey, you, you're finally awake" says some external voice. You see that you are in a room with a bomb, you start wondering why are you in this room, how did you get her, why....OH NO THERE IS A TIME LIMIT. 20 seconds is all you are give to find the correct wire connected to the clock. Pick the right one or the bomb explodes!!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who likes games that pressure you to think quickly and on ur toes. Also I saw that a bomb defusing child's game was banned so target audience 12+? 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
ONLY 20 SECONDS!
</li>
